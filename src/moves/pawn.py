"""Implements pawn promotion and en passant.

En passant captures are indicated by specifying:
-   the capturing pawn's file of departure,
-   the "Ã—", and
-   the destination square (not the square of the captured pawn)

NOTE: En Passant is a capturing move, and so long we provide a trailing ghost target, no need for special implementation.
Notation is precisely the same too.

Pawn promotion
    When a pawn promotes, the piece promoted to is indicated at the end of the move notation,
    for example: e8Q (promoting to queen). In standard FIDE notation, no punctuation is used;
    in Portable Game Notation (PGN) and many publications, pawn promotion is indicated by the equals sign (e8=Q).

NOTE: Promotions can be either moves or captures so, either we inherit from both `Move` and `Capture` or,
we modify the representations of the two latter to accomodate for promotions.
